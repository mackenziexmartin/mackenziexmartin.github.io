			<center><h1> About Me </h1> </center>
				<p> My name is Mackenzie Marie Martin and I am currently 20 years old. I was born in a small town approximately 45 minutes away from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. I spent the first 16 years of my life there until my father and step-mother wanted to move to Tennessee. I spent my junior and senior year in Cosby, Tennessee working in Gatlinburg. I worked at 3 different tourist attractions, which include: the Skycenter, Gatlinburg Space Needle and Arcadia, and Breakout Escape Room Games. <span id="dot">...</span><span id="more">When I was 17, I joined the US Army and went to basic training and AIT in July 2021, right after high school. I have a pretty cool job and now I have drill once a month. My old unit was in Nashville Tennessee, where I had to make the grueling 4-5 hour drive one way. I transfered to the unit on Fort Jackson and now I currently reside about 25 minutes away from campus with my boyfriend. I have an almost 4 year old Boston Terrier named Peanut. </p>

			<center><h1>My Future Career Plans </h1></center>
				<p> I am not the brightest student, as school has always been difficult for me. Merely every subject is brain wrenching, but not psychology. I am majoring in psychology because it is the one thing that makes sense to me every single time. The concept is always easily understood for me and I find it very easy to comprehend. My whole life, my friends would come to me for advice and trust me with their problems because they say they always feel better having talked to me. <span id="dot"></span><span id ="more">I really enjoy helping people and talking with them about what is going on in their lives. As I mentioned above, I am in the Army and my job has to do with psychology. I will obtain my bachelors and masters back to back to get a job in psychology, as you pretty much need a masters to do anything. My main goal is to work in a contracted goverment job helping military veterans with PTSD and trauma, so I will be studying trauma during grad school, I hope. I will also be staying in the military, as it helps pay for my schooling. I hope to one day open up my own practice after I retire around 40-45. </p>
